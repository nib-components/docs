# Git

## Introduction

We use [Git](http://git-scm.com/docs) as our version control system.

When updating or adding to our components we ask that you follow these steps.

* Make the desired changes to the component
* Bump the version of the component in it's component.json file
* Add your changes  

  ```git add .``` ... or ...  ```git add --all :/``` ... or ... ```git add <filename>```

* Commit your changes 

  ```git commit -m "I totally added some awesome-sauce to this component"```

* [Tag your changes](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag) in relation to the component.json version 

  ```git tag X.X.X```

* Push your changes 

  ```git push origin master```
  
* and finally, push your tags 
  
  ```git push --tags```


####Deleting tags
But **oh-no!**... you've been sloppy and left an error in your commited code! What if we could [delete that tag](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-tag), make the changes and create that tag again ?! Well, stop thinking, lets do it:

First, lets delete the tag locally

```git tag -d X.X.X```

If this tag was pushed to github, we better remove it.

```git push origin :refs/tags/X.X.X```

Update your changes and follow the steps above, all over again.
