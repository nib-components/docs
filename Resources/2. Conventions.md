## Coding Styleguide/Conventions

A list of coding conventions to follow:

- [Code Conventions for the JavaScript Programming Language](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html) by Douglas Crockford
- The new version of component allows use of [SEMVER](http://semver-ftw.org/) ranges. When versioning components be careful to follow SEMVER conventions to avoid breaking projects. e.g. breaking changes should use a new major version.
