# Utilities

Along with the idea of creating Blocks, there are also simple utility classes that we can use to help
simplify the blocks we create. Some of the things utilities cover:

* Floating
* Clearing floats
* Display properties (inline, block, inline-block)
* Simple fractional widths (1 of 5, 1 of 6 etc.)
* Media blocks
* Hiding and showing elements
* Truncating text

There are many more uses. They are really simple patterns that we need to write all the time. These
classes don't have any restrictions on naming, but are usually in the format:

```css
.pull-left {}
```
