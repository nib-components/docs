# Reading

The follow articles should be considered required reading before writing an CSS.

## [Idiomatic CSS](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)

A guide for best-practice CSS. Follow this. Seriously. Do it.

## [Suit CSS](https://github.com/suitcss)

A perfect example of CSS packages. These are all available as Component packages too
so make use of them. If in doubt about how to code good CSS modules, look here.

## [BEM Syntax](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/)

A good guide to writing efficient, modular CSS using the BEM style (Block, Element, Modifier).
All CSS modules should follow this pattern.

## [On Semantics](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/)

One thing we focus on now is maintainability over semantics. CSS selectors are purely for
developers, so we focus on writing easy to maintain CSS over pointless semantics. You're going
to be working with this code everyday, having it maintainable will keep you sane.
