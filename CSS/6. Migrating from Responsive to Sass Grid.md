# Migrating from responsive-grid to sass-grid

Part of our proposed new fed tooling includes utilising the new [sass-grid](https://github.com/nib-styles/sass-grid) for nib projects. Unfortunately upgrading an existing solution from the old to the new grid is a *very* manual process. This is a guide for how to do this as efficiently as possible.

## Install dependencies
**npm:**

    npm install --save @nib-styles/sass-grid
    npm install --save @nib-styles/sass-spacing

**component:**

    component install nib-styles/sass-grid
    component install nib-styles/sass-spacing

## Straight find and replace

Because the old grid uses classes for everything and the new grid uses custom data-attributes primarily, we are not able to simply find and replace the majority of the grid tags. However there are three that we can:

`rg-Grid` is replaced by `grid`

`rg-Unit` is replaced by `grid__unit`

`rg-Page` is replaced by `content`

## Columns utils

`rg-([0-9]{1,2})of([0-9]{1,2})` finds all column classes e.g. `rg-4of12`

Each of these will need to be replaced by a new attribute specifying the number of cols e.g. `g-xl="cols:4"`. There are some instances where an exact swap is not possible *(for example `rg-5of8` equates to 7.5 cols)* and should be catered for on a case by case basis.

## Display & alignment utils

`rg-([a-z,A-Z]{1,20})At([0-9]{1,2})` finds all display and text-alignment classes e.g. `rg-invisibleAt10` or `rg-textRightAt4`

The old grid used to reply on rg-textCenterAtX on the rg-Grid class to center the rg-Units, which then overrode the text alignment back to whatever desired alignment. This will still work, but the enw grid has a better way using `halign:center`

## Spacing utils

`rg-([a-z]{1,2})([0-6]{1})at([0-9]{1,2})` finds all margin and padding classes e.g. `rg-mt3at6`

## Find all
Alternatively, simply searching for `rg-` would return all grid related classes. The regex approach helps to segregate the types of classes which would have been helpful if we'd been able to automate this process. Perhaps you might be able to :)
